	/// <summary>
	/// This class is used to control which <see cref="StorageNetworkBuilding"/> can be connected with eachother.
	/// Voxel Tycoon only dictates that certain buildings can connect with eachother based on their type. With this patch a system is introduced where it is also possible to filter connections based on custom logic.
	/// Filters are classes implementing <see cref="IConnectionFilter"/>, and have the functionality to allow or disallow a connection between two <see cref="StorageNetworkBuilding"/>. 
	/// These filter classes are made by the user and can be registered with <see cref="ConnectionController.RegisterConnectionFilter(IConnectionFilter, double)"/>.
	/// Every time a new <see cref="StorageNetworkBuilding"/> is placed, Voxel Tycoon will update the Storage Network, but only for the <see cref="StorageNetworkBuilding"/> which are in range of the placed building.
	/// To update the Storage Network, Voxel Tycoon will use <see cref="StorageBuildingManager.FindSiblings(StorageNetworkBuilding)"/> for each <see cref="StorageNetworkBuilding"/> that needs an update and returns a list with all potential connections.
	/// Before this list with potential connections is returned, <see cref="InvalidateSiblingsPatch"/> allows all filters to cycle through this list and decide if a connection should be allowed or not.
